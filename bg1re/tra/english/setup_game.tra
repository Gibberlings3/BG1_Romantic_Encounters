To Dawn Priest Blaise, of the Song of the Morning Temple, East of Beregost, from Sister Sapientia of the Temple of Oghma, in Candlekeep.

14 Tarsakh: My dear love,

I thought of you this morning while weeding the kitchen garden. The sun cleared the Keep's walls and lit up the dew, making the young spinach and the staked peas rich and strange...


22 Tarsakh: There was a plague of frogs in the refectory this morning, and much wailing and flapping of robes as Honoured Scholars fled the hopping menace. I fear that Pink Lightning and Gorion's child are behind this, somehow. I should be outraged at the indignity, but as I write a frog sits on my page, green as new moss and no larger than my thumb-nail. Now, regarding your thoughts on metempsychosis...


28 Tarsakh: We have been working lamb skins into parchment for the past week. The smell is atrocious and my hands ache. Thank you for the pens! I have the blackest of black ink...


1 Mirtul: Has it been forty years already? Forty years since you asked Candlekeep for a clean copy of Sanderly's Aubades? It is the blink of an eye, my love.

With the roads so dangerous of late I do not know when I can send this, but I will strive to find a reliable messenger.

As ever yours,

Sister Sapientia~

May I call you Garrick?  I hope that's not too forward.  I doubt you will remember me, just one adventurer among many as I am, and I could not stay to chat after the unpleasantness with those paladins.  But I wanted you to know how deeply I admired your rendition of "Gathering Pease-Blossoms" and afterwards, the smoothness of your modulation into Gilraen's "Frolique in A Major" as I broke a table over Sir Reynald's head was simply sublime.  Marvellous.  Extraordinary.  
 
Enclosed is a small token of my esteem, a ring looted from the grave of an ancient prince and guaranteed curse-free!  It would please me if you wore my colour on your finger.
 
Come away with me.  Be *my* bard.  I will shower you in jewels and silk and string your harp with the guts of my enemies.  (Your fingers are so nimble and sensitive, and your sense of rhythm so exquisite that I find myself wondering how it would be if - but that is a question for another time.)
 
Simply travel eastwards away from the Sword Coast and I will hear of your coming.  And I will find you.

I've got a lead on a good haul.  Forget about Ulcaster School: old books are boring.  I found an old merchant who sold me a family heirloom - it was pricey but I could just feel the magic sizzling off it and couldn't pass it by.  Poor fellow, if he'd only known what he was selling... but that is not my problem.

Now I have the wardstone to Durlag's Tower!  I'll just toddle off south, clean out that heap of stone, profit, and set up shop at the Inn with the proceeds.

@214  = ~Letter to Skie Silvershield~
@215  = ~From Lord Eddard Silvershield, Marquis of Dumley, to the Right Honourable Skie Silvershield, at her estate in the City of Baldur's Gate,
 
Greetings and Felicitations, my Dearest Sister.
 
I trust that you have been attending well to your books and your dance lessons, and that your first Season ended with appropriate grandeur.  

My own journey goes well.  With the roads so dangerous, trade goods are much sought after and our simple wagons are often feted by the towns we visit - most bemusing.  We travel quite carefully, avoid the main Trade Routes, and have had not a bit of trouble.  The Forest Animals are quite unafraid, often walking straight up to our Cavalcade, and my sketchbook grows very fat.  I enclose this likeness of a Fox, which I saw lounging by the bole of a tree in the small hours.  It had a louche, piratical air, and stared at me for a good five minutes before slouching off.  I have suffered from a cold since leaving the city, alas - sleeping wrapped in a single blanket under the bare and chilly stars is a Romantic Prospect, but trying to the Constitution of one unused to it.  The pot of Myrnickle's Balsam you gave me has been most helpful.  
 
How odd it is that words to you come so easily on Paper, when they whistle away in my throat when I stand before my Little Sister; when I take refuge in the promptings of an Etiquette Book, inquire prettily as to your well-being, and give my due obeisances to our Father.  But this cold morning it is between us and the paper, and so I give you - a Fox, a Terrible Cold, and this - 
 
When our Mother died it was difficult for me.  I missed her very much and, in my distress, fled the Bonds of Family when I should have striven to tie them tighter around us three.  I was a Fool - and I still am a Fool, to my woe.  I ask you not to inquire as to my reasons for leaving Town; you would not like the answer.
 
Regarding this Musical Friend of whom they speak, all I can say is that I hope the fellow treats you with the Respect and Courtesy that you deserve, Skyling, and pray to Sune that you weather the storms ahead.  Love is an Awkward Beast, as our family knows well.
 
My regards to Father and Step-Mama Brilla.  I am to them, as always, a Dutiful Son.

Your Loving Brother,

Eddard~

My dear lady Alyth,
 
My master, Magus Davaeorn, has once again allowed me the pleasure of writing to you to thank you for the latest shipment of fine sweetmeats and wine from Calimshan and to submit our order for next month. Living apart, as we do, from civilization makes me quite grateful not only for such refined fare as you routinely provide, but the opportunity to correspond with such an accomplished and beauteous lady. I have enjoyed reading the personal messages and receiving the small gifts you include with your shipping invoices. The packet of 'candy kisses', for example, was quite a nice treat (is it too saucy of me to inquire if the real ones are as tasty?). As supplier of my victuals, I insist you replenish my supply immediately.
 
In response to your question (or, should I say, your invitation) in your last private note: I would very much appreciate the opportunity to visit your establishment, and yourself, in person. There is only the matter of Magus Davaeorn's permission. I humbly beg your indulgence as my Master is not the most permissive of employers and is unlikely to allow me to leave here. Perhaps you might send a note requesting personal attention to some matter from one of our staff. Then I might more easily broach the subject with him. The chance of seeing you, one way or another, shall enhance my persuasiveness, I am sure.
 
Ever yours,
 
Stephan~

I did not even have to raise my eyes to know that your delicate little fingers were creating beauty so close to me.

@229  = ~Sweet Tamah,
You told me when we first met that I reminded you of your mother's grandfather; an Elvish Scholar of some fame in Trademeet. You felt intimidated by our difference in ages, by the scope and breadth of my knowledge, and by my more extensive experience of life. You said your meager sum of years and knowledge made you feel as if you were inadequate for the job I offered you. Ah, my tempestuous lover! Know now I felt equally inadequate to love such a magnificent woman as you. In my bed and in my arms, my centuries were mere moments in comparison to your instinctive, boundless knowledge of love's satisfaction. I have felt as much a child as you have, my dear, when you have told me of the outer worlds' beauties, explained that stableboy Dreppin's jokes, and, not least, guided me from unreasoning desire to unmatched pleasure. Consider, then, that in this and in most other things, we are properly matched partners regardless of our ages.

This morning when I woke up, alone as is now usual, I thought about the feel of your hair in my hands.  Its weight on my palms just before the silken soft strands slip through my ink-stained fingers.  It is a brilliant, shining halo of glory that adorns your temples, my dear.  I would give all of my remaining mornings if I could once more run your ebony comb through the threads after a night spent with the long, loose ends tickling my lips or spread luxuriously across my pillow.

There is little today in my thoughts that can entirely banish the memory of your eyes.  Wide and deep as a slow moving river.  But oh, how they brightened when you smiled!  They shone like they were lit from within by a fierce inferno of flame.  And for what?  For the centuries old joke of the pedant you said you loved.  Truly, my love, I am both humbled and amazed by the joy  you found in my presence and never cease to wonder at the mystery of it all.
--C.~
@232  = ~Dear Tamah,
My heart stirred with pain, but it took a moment to remember that today marked five years since the day you left.  There is still no space in my grief to enjoy any of the small pleasures that once were in my life.  Why?  Because in 20 brief years you made your imprint upon each small measure of happiness.  I still cannot work, cannot eat, cannot sleep (nay!  Not even reverie) without being reminded of your loss.  The sharp absent presence is ever beside me; a shadow crossing the face of the sun of my life.  How I wish you would return.
--C.~
@233  = ~Lovely Tamah,
Ah, my dear, I feel your absence keenly not just in moments of solitude, but also when in company with those I call my friends. You had such a quick wit that they all respected you despite your youth. You easily traded barbs with Ulraunt and jokes with Gorion. You could discuss an episode of Cormyr history with Phlydia as easily as exchange dirty jokes with Withrop. I had never regarded my own tongue as lacking until I met you. In your presence, it stumbles and stutters over even the slightest word. Only my eyes' expression of love for you was eloquent, engaged as they were in admiring your confidence and joie de vivre.

You were drawing the illustrations and I was to apply colored inks and gold leaf. Ah... such naughty images you created, my dear. Yet also so beautiful. Only a scribe of my long years can appreciate how rarely an illustrator of your talent comes along. Only one like you, who could tease an old elf like myself back to vigorous manhood. We were illustrating the scene where Coreddon caresses Ephemera in the garden, I remember, and your hand brushed against mine. My heart was already yours, my darling, but I feared to speak lest you laugh at an old elf's fantasies. Trembling, I laid my hand on yours, and you asked if you could be my Ephemera. The lips I had once only employed for speaking were put to finer use, beloved; that night, I certainly tried to be Coreddon, although I doubt Ulraunt would have appreciated knowing the use we made of his patch of begonias in Candlekeep's garden!

@235  = ~Tamah,
How many ways can I tell you that you were right? That someday I, too, would rage against the walls of Candlekeep like a bird in a cage. I sought out Candlekeep so that I would never have to face my fears, but here I am, gazing solidly at them. Let me speak briefly of my childhood, Tamah. I was born in Waterdeep in 1032 DR, the year the master-mage Aghairon became the first lord of Waterdeep and brought that city a government based on reason instead of the strength of arms. I should know: my parents were his friends and were slain during an attempted uprising by one of the defeated Warlords Aghairon had supplanted. From childhood, therefore, I have been afraid to love anyone. As peaceful as it has become, Waterdeep still seethes with the ambition of its guildmasters. I have never felt safe anywhere save Candlekeep. Yet, my wise Tamah, you were right. Even hidden away in my tower, love found me. Passion briefly ruled my nights and sweet harmony my days. By trying to keep you near me, I drove you away... Alas, I have still lost my dearest friend and companion! With your strength to keep fear at bay, my love, I know I can leave here. With your hand, this life can be changed.

@236  = ~My Tamah,
I was looking out the window this afternoon and saw that the swallows had returned to the eaves of the Library. They shelter in the carvings and embellishments of the building. One pair has chosen to build their nest on the window ledge of our... My bedroom. I wept, though I welcome this little pair and their babies to my humble abode. Remind me, my sweet... Did we not once talk of marrying? Of children? Did we not tease each other with our notions of a child with my chin and your eyes? I suppose I could recall every word in reverie if I did not fear that the memory would drive me mad. Families and children have drifted into Candlekeep, my love; Winthrop and Gorion have each adopted a child. The noise of children's feet echo in the Library Halls and <CHARNAME>, Gorion's child, has twice knocked over my ink bottles. I should have been angered, but, instead, I gave <PRO_HIMHER> a colored pencil and a blank scroll to draw on. Did I once have the chance for many such obvious expressions of love with my own children? How could I have been so blind?

@237  = ~My Beloved Tamah,
It has been years since you left me, my dear one, and my desk drawers are beginning to be stuffed with letters to you. I desperately need some way to contact you even though I have no idea where you've gone. But then it occurred to me: you are a gifted Illuminator. Far more skilled than I, in fact. From the first, the nobles would pay a premium for samples of your work. And now, a 'Tamah' edition of a book is valuable. I know it would amuse you to discover that one lordling just gained entry to Candlekeep with one of our 'special' editions of Celsor's 'Seduction of a Nymph.' How appalled they would all be if they knew what fine lovemaking occurred just inches away from every edition we created! But I am forgetting my purpose in writing today.Somewhere you must be working for a wealthy family or a private library. If I send out a book... you might read it. You might even remember where we used to hide our love-notes to each other. And find this letter... I shall start inserting my letters into the books of poetry that I copy for patrons. Hopefully, at least one might reach your eyes and tell you of my continuing love for you. I am not concerned with anything that has happened between your departure and when you read this, my beloved. I want you back.
--C.~
@238  = ~My Love... My Tamah,
Ulraunt laughs now whenever I refer to you, dear one. For even with the passage of three decades, I still call you 'my love.' Nor is his attitude unusual. Most humans acquainted with me at the least find this continuing attachment odd, calling it an 'Elven bond' and shaking their heads in pity, as if I were some kind of fool to still love you. Even you, nearest and dearest to my heart, failed to understand how I could have held my heart in reserve for three hundred years until you (!) invaded my life and held such benevolent tyranny over its solitary beat. Know then, darling, that even amongst such curiously faithful beings as elves there are those who astound their own kind with their reclusiveness. I was one such; as a youth, I was cold and unmoved by emotion. My parents named me 'órëlóra' ('heartless') for my detached distance. My attachment has always been to ancient secrets and hidden lore. I became a mage of no small power in my prime, before I forsook magic for the delight of pure knowledge. I laughed at my fellows--Elves and Men alike--who formed bonds of love only to see them sundered by the servants of Time. Imagine, then, my surprise when I met you. I was stirred to life: I ran madly after you in the Library Halls and across the gardens of Candlekeep! I had to immerse myself in contemplation of your beauty and bring you, half-laughing, half-groaning, to pleasure that neither of us had known before. First and last in my heart, Tamah... Of course you are still 'my love'!!
--C.~
@239  = ~My Sweet Tamah,
I write this letter at the truly indecent hour of half past three. I have lain awake for long enough and shall merely start my day early with a note to you. I need not sleep at all, as you know, but reverie lately has brought me only endless repetitions of our final argument and your overly hasty departure. The blankness of sleep, however, has fled from me and left me yearning for your body. I would so love to return to those days when we slept naked and entwined together. I long to smell you, taste you, feel the texture of your skin against my lips and tongue. But alas, my rosebud, only in my memory may I, like the butterfly, breathe your heady perfume and lap nectar from your silky petals. I am utterly alone in these small hours; I must tame my rebellious flesh without your kind assistance. Gods help me!
--C.~
@240  = ~To My Dear Tamah,
Once, when we were talking of marriage, I remember telling you of the most ancient of Elven customs: the exchange of the vows of eternal love. You were surprised to discover that Elves need no church-buildings, no priests, no ceremonies, and no approval of state and local constabulary to bond. Those, my love, are just the trappings to a basic agreement between willing and loving partners. I have never been averse to human weddings--have been invited to more than a few in my time--but find them amusingly repetitive. I would marry you any way you might choose, my dear, but I will always remind you that I am already yours. The words we spoke to each other in Candlekeep Garden when we declared our love for each other were my vow of commitment. I need no other promises to eternally be your man. Take this ring as proof of my words that you are the only woman I wish to be married to.
--C.~
@241  = ~Forgive me, Tamah,
This morning I remembered our final argument... again... but with a difference. In my mind, once again you stormed off in such rage because I would not leave the safety of Candlekeep. Once again, you reminded me that the Keeper of Tomes disliked our pairing and would only begrudgingly permit us to raise children here. My protest that that he did not forbid us--that we could have a family here--fell on nearly deaf ears. I remember that you said you wanted to feel the freedom of a life without the border of stone walls and to daily hear the chorus of young voices around you as you suckle your youngest. You wanted to know that all of them would have open fields and woodland to explore instead of the stale air of the Library halls. The normal noises of nature instead of the murmur of whispers in enforced silence. All of this I remembered, love, but with a difference. This time, knowing what I did not know then--what it meant to live with only your absent presence beside me, I imagined myself giving in and giving you what you so dearly want. Why the difference? órëlóra has become quantë órë... My heart is full...
--C.~
@242  = ~My dear <CHARNAME>,
<DAYANDMONTH>, in the Year of the Banner, <YEAR>.
I am writing in haste a final note... This time for you. When I got up this morning, I sensed excitement in the air. I felt that something in my life was about to change. Even if this means I am to face my own demise, my whole heart yearns to embrace that change. You might think it foolish of me to believe this, but I am certain that I am to see Tamah today, even if only in whatever afterlife is permitted a man who will not enter Arvanaith without his human lover beside him. But I am rambling and have momentarily forgotten my purpose in writing...I am going to ask something of you, <CHARNAME>, being well aware that you have been kept in the dark about your past (those of us who knew were forbidden to speak of it lest we attract...unwanted...attention). I ask you to embrace change. Refusing to do so can only lead to unhappiness. This is the lesson I wish to pass on to you. Learn it well. I include in this note a small token of my esteem. It has served me well in my life. May it serve you at least as well.
Ever Your Friend,

   And nearer hes to setting.

That age is best which is the first,
   When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
   Times still succeed the former.

Then be not coy, but use your time,
   And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
   You may forever tarry.~

Said the sun to the moon,
You cannot stay.

Change
Says the moon to the waters,
All is flowing.

Change
Says the fields to the grass,
Seed-time and harvest,
Chaff and grain.

You must change said,
Said the worm to the bud,
Though not to a rose,

Petals fade
That wings may rise
Borne on the wind.

You are changing
said death to the maiden, your wan face
To memory, to beauty.

Are you ready to change?
Says the thought to the heart, to let her pass
All your life long

For the unknown, the unborn
In the alchemy
Of the world's dream?

You will change,
says the stars to the sun,
Says the night to the stars.

(The spine of this book is a bit thicker than usual.)~

I found Scar's vase in a chandler's store caled "Donnerjan's Second-Hand Shop" at Baldur's Gate Carnival! I should ask the vendor where he got it from. I know this vase was precious to Scar. I saw it when visiting his private quarters.~
