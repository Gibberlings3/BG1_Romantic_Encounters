## GENERAL

Baldur's Gate Romantic Encounters Modification (BG1RE) is a mod for BG1, adding several encounters and quests all over the game. 

For BG1RE, not every component deals with the PC trying to sneak into someone's pants or vice versa. BG1RE aims at populating BG1 with romantic encounters, intense dialogues, unexpected private dinners, romantic traces of long lost times, and real quests that all deal with true love, fulfilled or unfulfilled. 
It also offers encounters for the PC's quick relief, of course, with either paid companions or willing strangers. For some encounters, the PC should brush him-/herself, as it might be (s)he comes out flustered if (s)he doesn't stop in time.

Note: If downloading from GitHub, make sure you download the latest release from the releases page!
